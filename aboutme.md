subtitle: What makes me such a good data scientist.
---

I have the following qualities:

- I have proficient experience with data exploration and in-depth statistics.
- I'm great with designing and working with NLP's.
- I actively use Linux every day, even when I'm doing things non-data science related.
- SQL is beyond amazing to me, and I love working with it.
- Every team I've ever been on loves working with me.

 In other words, I'm in high demand!
