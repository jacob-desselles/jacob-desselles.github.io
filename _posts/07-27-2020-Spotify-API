title: Can We Predict Songs You Would Like?
---
Last month, a team of students and I designed an API for Spotify that would take songs you "liked" and returned a list of 20 other songs that it feels like you would enjoy.
The catch is, though, that it wasn't locked to genre! This was a very fun, if exhausting, project to do, considering we only have three days to actually work on it.
My role consisted of helping design the Flask app and helping it connect to the database, along with designing the visuals for how the model would work.
You'll be able to find the API here.
